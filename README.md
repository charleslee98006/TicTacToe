# TicTacToe

Introduction:

This is an frontend only web application that is stored via github using the github project pages. I used HTML5, CSS3, JS, jQuery as my tools for this app.

The approach to this was to get static information and the tictactoe game working. 

Here are a couple of assumptions that I have made in order to push out the app:

	1. This will be Player vs Player - Player vs. AI would come later if more time is given.
	2. Tested the function in FireFox and in Chrome only. - IE can be tested later. Will need to decide who browser to support.
	3. Usage of some SFX - To give the user feedback for the user interaction with the UI.
	4. Application is not mobile responsive yet.

Plans for further development:

	1. Integrate a NodeJS backend and connect with MongoDB
		a. Implement http get and push request in Express.
		b. Set up MongoDB configuration.
		c.  Add AngularJS Framework for a complete MEAN Stack
	2. Implement via media queries to make web application responsive.
	3. Create UI for both sides to display scores for both players, which will be stored in DB and pulled from it.
	4. Implement a Clear Score feature that will access the DB and clear the score for both players
	5. Add GruntJS and SASS for precompiling of SCSS/SASS files.
